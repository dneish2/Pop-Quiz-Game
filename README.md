# Pop-Quiz-Game
Pop is a dynamic website in which users have to log in to become a player and be matched up against other players. Players have the option of creating a game or joining a game. Players will be asked a series of questions and whoever gets the most right will be positioned on the leaderboard.
This webite was made as a final class proejct in my second web programming class to display the front-end skills I've learned at the time and connecting them to a database. The languages and frameworsk used in this proejct was atom, html/CSS, PHP & a local WAMP database. This project is dynamic in the sense that user info is push and stored, but the "matchmaking" feature ha been "shelfed."
